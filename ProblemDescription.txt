#### STATE
A state of free cell problem has the following properties:
- A counter, that stores number of cards left
- Several piles of cards.
- Each pile contains none or some cards
- Each card appears in exactly one pile.

#### INITIAL STATE
A state with:
- initial counter
- Certain number of piles
- Each piles with none or few cards. Each card appearing only once from 1 to counter

#### SUCCESSOR FUNCTION
At each state the successor function does one of the following:
- Take a card on top of some pile, and place it on top of another pile, if it is larger that top of that pile.
- Take the card on top of some pile and place it on an empty pile.
- Take the card on top of some pile and discard, if and only if the card is same as the counter, then decrement the counter.

#### GOAL TEST
When the counter is equals to 0


#### Heuristic 1
Number of cards that are left in the piles


#### Heuristic 2
The sum of the following:
- Number of move to get to card with counter value (number of cards on top of the card with value equals to card)
- Plus (+) number of cards in the pile (i.e., counter)
